# Server-Driven-Web-App
Server-driven web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Node.js and Express.js, MongoDB.

The app allows users to register for an account. Registered users can log in and access all database related views and user history, 
upload files, add, update and delete items in the database and fetch items in the database by criteria. By default, these views 
will be hidden from the end-user and unauthenticated users will only see the "home" page.
